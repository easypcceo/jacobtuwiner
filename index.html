Hi!

My name is Jacob Tuwiner, and this is my personal site. 

You'll find a ton of great stuff here about B2B sales, marketing, <a href="/cold-email/">cold email</a>, and my general thoughts on life as well. 

<h2>What I've done so far</h2>

Here is a list of my past experiences. 

I plan on writing a post about each one, in terms of what my role was and what the experience taught me about business and life. 

<h3>Flipping on eBay</h3>

I saw a few episodes of the show American Pickers and thought I could do something similar. 

My birthday is in November so by June of 2016, I had my license. That meant I could finally drive to yard sales, thrift shops, Goodwill, and discount stores to buy items for cheap. 

Once at the store, I'd find an item that I thought I could flip. I'd search for it on eBay and view the search results using the "Completed Listings" filter.

This filter shows the results of different listings, including whether or not they sold, and what they sold (or didn't sell) for. 

With this strategy, I would buy items that I saw selling more often than not on eBay. I could also easily figure out what they were selling for. 

For instance, I bought a set of golf clubs at Goodwill for $15 and sold them for $80 on eBay. Not bad for a 16 year old! 

Yard sales were another gold mine - a lot of people sell books at yard sales for $0.25 each. I'd offer to buy the whole lot for $0.05/book and most people were happy to take the deal. 

On eBay, you can list a book on auction. I'd start the listing at $0.99 and let people bid from there. Most of the books sold for more than $5 each. On top of that, I'd charge $6 for shipping and only pay $2 for shipping, which was a guaranteed $4 profit per sale. 

Sure, I was only making $10 per sale, but that's 200x what I paid for each book. Not too shabby.

<h3>Starting a YouTube Channel</h3>

My YouTube career began at 13, similarly to most 13 year old squeakers:

I posted Call of Duty gameplay commentary videos. 

My first videos were pretty bad to say the least, not just because of the production quality, but the content itself.

If I could sum them up with 1 word, it'd be cringe. 

I used YouTube as my therapist to vent about everything going on in my life, from the stupid things I was doing to the girls that put me in the friendzone. 

Little did I know, some of the people I was talking about in the videos, saw the videos… yeah that was hairy. That's when I learned the internet is public, and once something is on the internet, you can't take it back. 

Eventually I pivoted from storytime commentaries to videos about computers. I had become interested in PC gaming, and I was learning a lot about building gaming PCs. 

I started posting YouTube videos talking about the best gaming PC build for different budgets, like the best gaming PC under 700 dollars. 

The videos did well – they started getting hundreds, then thousands, and some tens of thousands of views. I was ecstatic.

At that time, I was just making money from the video ads, but the earnings were terribly small. I think my channel – with roughly 500,000 total video views – has only made around $200 in ad revenue. 

That's when I learned about affiliate marketing. 

Here's how it works:

I send customers to an e-commerce store like Amazon where they can buy the parts I'm talking about, and Amazon pays me a percentage of each sale in return. 

Each video I posted included affiliate links to all of the parts in the description, and my channel started making a lot more money. I actually used my earnings to build my first gaming PC. 

I was super passionate about YouTube at the time - my passion for it has since died down, but the videos still generate passive income. 

Passive income, for those of you who don't know, is money deposited into your bank account without you having to do anything (after the initial work is done). 

For example, all of the YouTube videos I've published still get views every day. 

I still make a few hundred bucks a month from them too – not much, but hey, it's not bad considering I haven't published one in ages. 

Unlike a job where you only get paid for the hours you're clocked in, passive income pays you non-stop, even when you're sleeping, so you have the time (and the freedom) to do what you want to do with your life, not what others want you to do. 

<i>Lessons I Learned from YouTube:</i>

<ol>
<li>Everything on the internet is public and permanent </li>
<li>If you understand search engines, you can get a lot of eyeballs on your content</li>
<li>Companies will pay you a lot of money for sending them customers </li>
<li>I got my first taste of passive income </li>
</ol>

<h3> Market Table Bistro </h3>

<img alt="market table bistro" src="/img/bistro/dish-1.jpg">

<p>The Bistro is a fine dining restaurant in Lovettesville, Virigina, right across the bridge from Brunswick, MD, a small town where I grew up. </p>

<p>After getting my license and a car, insurance and gas weren't going to pay themselves. That's what my dad was for :)</p>

<p>In all seriousness, I needed a job for some extra spending money and, more importantly, I wanted to know what it was like working with a team. </p>

<p>It was my first and only "real job" - Chef Jason hired me as a dishwasher. </p>

<p>And despite being paid minimum wage to work in a hot kitchen, this job taught me more than I could've asked for anywhere else.</p>

<p>From organization and efficiency, to teamwork and communication, my time at the Bistro set the foundation of the work ethic I have today. </p>

<p>Furthermore, it gave me a newfound respect for those in the service industry - every time I went out to eat, I was grateful to be actually be seated and enjoying a meal, as I knew how much work was going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>To this day, I still reminisce while eating at a restaurant when I can see the dishwasher hard at work through the kitchen door's window.</p> 

<p>Thanks to what I learned at the Bistro, I not only can wash dishes incredibly fast, but I actually learned a lot about cooking as well, not to mention how to bounce back after getting yelled at for making a stupid mistake.</p>

<p>The funniest thing about my time at the Bistro, however, was my obsession with calculating how many plates I had to wash to afford whatever I was purchasing.</p>

<p>"Hmm, a new stereo sounds nice, but is it worth washing 400 plates?"</p>

<i>Lessons I learned from working at the Bistro:</i>

<ol>
	<li>It's okay to make mistakes, as long as you don't make the same mistake twice</li>
	<li>When you make a mistake, you can't lose momentum. Fix it quickly and get back on the saddle</li>
	<li>Hard work pays off</li>
	<li>Working in a restaurant is HARD.</li>
	<li>Teamwork makes the dreamwork</li>
	<li>Move quickly, break things, keep moving.</li>
	<li>Efficiency and organization are key</li>
	<li>Cooking is awesome!</li>
</ol>
