<p>I'm passionate about traveling. I want to travel through Europe and Asia with only a backpack and my laptop for months on end.</p>

<p>I love experiencing different cultures and, most especially, enjoying the beauty of the earth.</p>

I'm working on yet another site at the moment, but it hasn't been made public yet. Once it's live, I'll be sure to drop the link here too!

<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>

<p>I currently work as a freelance content writer. At the moment, I write for 5 websites in addition to mine, though I've written for dozens of publications over the past two years.</p>

<p>In particular, I worked as a blockchain writer for Cryptoslate, a cryptocurrency news company.</p>

<p>I also write for a PC gaming website, mostly creating product reviews and how-to style posts.</p>
