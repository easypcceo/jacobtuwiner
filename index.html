Hi!

My name is Jacob Tuwiner, and this is my personal site. 

You'll find a ton of great stuff here about B2B sales, marketing, <a href="/cold-email/">cold email</a>, and my general thoughts on life as well. 

Right now I'm selling for Experiment 27, a marketing agency for ambitious B2B companies that have high ticket clients and want a steady flow of leads each month.

In the past, I've flipped items on eBay (in high school) and worked as a dishwasher at a restaurant, launched an affiliate website that sold over $1MM in product and was acquired, wrote as a freelance journalist for Cryptoslate, ran a link building agency, and traveled the world as a digital nomad for 7 months at age 19.

And did I mention I'm a college dropout? :) 

You can read my full story on the <a href="/about/">about page</a>.
