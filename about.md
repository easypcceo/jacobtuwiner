After working as a dishwasher/line cook at the [Market Table Bistro](https://www.markettablebistro.com/){: target="_blank"} for one year, I learned a ton about hard work, discipline, organization, and teamwork.

Above all else, I learned that working a traditional job wasn't for me. That's when I started [Easy PC](https://www.easypc.io/){: target="_blank"}, an affiliate website and YouTube channel that teaches PC gaming newbies how to assemble their first computer.

The blog reached over 30k/users per month within the first year, and when its income surpassed that of my job, I quit. To date, Easy PC is responsible for $1MM+ in e-commerce sales.

Alongside working on Easy PC, I was a freelance writer at [Cryptoslate](https://cryptoslate.com/){: target="_blank"} for one year, posting weekly articles on cryptocurrency/blockchain news, coin reviews, etc. During my time there I even had the honor of interviewing Jake Yocom-Piatt, the founder of Decred.

After high school, I attended [Towson University](https://www.towson.edu/){: target="_blank"} pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science, but one year in and college definitely wasn't for me. By my second semester, I was working hard to get SEO consulting clients and quit school.

Three clients later I dropped out of college and went on a 7 month trip around the world as a digital nomad. Along the way I spent time in Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Hungary and Romania. That's also when I started [Tuwiner SEO](https://tuwinerseo.com/){: target="_blank"}, a link outreach business.

Within 30 days I'd closed 8 clients using outbound marketing and was over the moon - I learned how to book meetings, talk to customers and close sales. Unfortunately, my fulfillment team wasn't squared away, and delivering those services became a challenge. I had to stop selling so I could catch up.

Fast forward to now - I realized my passion for sales, and my distaste for client fulfillment. I'd much rather talk to customers, understand their problems, and help them achieve their goals.

I sold Easy PC to focus on sales full-time, and recently joined [Experiment 27](https://x27marketing.com/){: target="_blank"} taking on a sales role. We help digital agencies and other B2B businesses book meetings with billion dollar brands and scale their companies to the moon.

Future gameplan?

Help a lot of people make more money and make some myself along the way - then, I can take my experience in the world of sales to start my own company one day (service business, SaaS tool, consulting, not sure yet). Either way, excited for what the future holds!
