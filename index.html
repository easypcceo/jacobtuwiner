Hi!

My name is Jacob Tuwiner, and this is my personal site. 

You'll find a ton of great stuff here about B2B sales, marketing, <a href="/cold-email/">cold email</a>, and my general thoughts on life as well. 

<h2>What I've done so far</h2>

Here is a list of my past experiences. 

I plan on writing a post about each one, in terms of what my role was and what the experience taught me about business and life.

<h3> Market Table Bistro </h3>

<img alt="market table bistro" src="/img/bistro/dish-1.jpg">

<p>The Bistro is a fine dining restaurant in Lovettesville, Virigina, right across the bridge from Brunswick, MD, a small town where I grew up. </p>

<p>After getting my license and a car, insurance and gas weren't going to pay themselves. That's what my dad was for :)</p>

<p>In all seriousness, I needed a job for some extra spending money and, more importantly, I wanted to know what it was like working with a team. </p>

<p>It was my first and only "real job" - Chef Jason hired me as a dishwasher. </p>

<p>And despite being paid minimum wage to work in a hot kitchen, this job taught me more than I could've asked for anywhere else.</p>

<p>From organization and efficiency, to teamwork and communication, my time at the Bistro set the foundation of the work ethic I have today. </p>

<p>Furthermore, it gave me a newfound respect for those in the service industry - every time I went out to eat, I was grateful to be actually be seated and enjoying a meal, as I knew how much work was going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>To this day, I still reminisce while eating at a restaurant when I can see the dishwasher hard at work through the kitchen door's window.</p> 

<p>Thanks to what I learned at the Bistro, I not only can wash dishes incredibly fast, but I actually learned a lot about cooking as well, not to mention how to bounce back after getting yelled at for making a stupid mistake.</p>

<p>The funniest thing about my time at the Bistro, however, was my obsession with calculating how many plates I had to wash to afford whatever I was purchasing.</p>

<p>"Hmm, a new stereo sounds nice, but is it worth washing 400 plates?"</p>
